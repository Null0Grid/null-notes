# Null Notes — recovered source (v0.3.1)

Rebuilt from the shipped `Null_Notes_0.3.1_x64-setup.exe` on 2026-10-18.

## What's original vs rewritten

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/` (HTML, JS, CSS, fonts, vendor libs) | **Original.** Extracted byte-for-byte from the brotli asset table inside `null-notes.exe`. It was never minified, so this is your source. |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, capabilities | Reconstructed from the config Tauri bakes into the binary (identifier, version, CSP, icons, author). Window size is a guess (1280×800); it isn't stored as text. |
| `src-tauri/src/*.rs` | **Rewritten.** Rust compiles to machine code, so the backend was re-implemented from the 31 commands the frontend calls, the error messages in the binary, and disassembly of the lock code. |
| `src-tauri/icons/` | Extracted from the exe's icon resource. |

## On-disk formats (kept compatible with the shipped app)

- App settings: `%APPDATA%\dev.nullgrid.notes\settings.json` → `{ "last": path|null, "recent": [paths] }` (max 10)
- Per-vault settings: `<vault>/.nullnotes/<name>.json` (`settings`, `graph`), name `[a-z0-9-]{1,40}`, ≤ 2 MB
- Saves are atomic: write `<file>.nntmp`, then rename
- Lock: `<vault>/.nullnotes/lock.json`
  `{ version: 1, kdf: "argon2id", m_kib: 65536, t: 3, p: 1, salt: b64(16), wrapped: b64(nonce|ct|tag) }`
  KEK = Argon2id v19 → 32 bytes; wrapped = XChaCha20-Poly1305(KEK, 32-byte data key, AAD `null-notes data key v1`)
- Locked note: `<note>.<ext>.lock` = `NNLOCK1\n` | nonce(24) | ciphertext | tag(16), AAD `NNLOCK1\n`
- Limits: edit 5 MB, images/imports 50 MB

The lock format was taken from disassembly, not tested against a file the
real app produced. Before trusting it with notes you care about, lock a
throwaway note in 0.3.1 and open it with this build.

## Build

```
cd src-tauri
cargo test --lib          # backend unit tests
cargo tauri build         # needs tauri-cli: cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"
```
